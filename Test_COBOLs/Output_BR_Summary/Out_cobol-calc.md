# Business Rules Summary
This document outlines four business rules related to mathematical operations on two numbers.
## Rule 1: Addition Operation (BR-002)
* Description: This rule calculates the total of two numbers by adding them together.
* Condition: `oper = '+'`
* Output:
	* If the condition is met: `total = firstnum + secondnum`
## Rule 2: Subtraction Operation (BR-003)
* Description: This rule calculates the total of two numbers by subtracting the second number from the first.
* Condition: `oper = '-'`
* Output:
	* If the condition is met: `total = firstnum - secondnum`
## Rule 3: Multiplication Operation (BR-004)
* Description: This rule calculates the total of two numbers by multiplying them together.
* Condition: `oper = '*'`
* Output:
	* If the condition is met: `total = firstnum * secondnum`
## Rule 4: Division Operation (BR-005)
* Description: This rule calculates the total of two numbers by dividing the first number by the second.
* Condition: `oper = '/'`
* Output:
	* If the condition is met: `total = firstnum / secondnum`
