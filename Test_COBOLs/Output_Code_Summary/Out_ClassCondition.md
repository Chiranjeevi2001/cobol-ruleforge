## COBOL Code Analysis: Data Type Inspection Program
This COBOL code demonstrates rudimentary data type inspection by identifying whether certain data items contain numeric or alphabetic characters. Here's a breakdown:

**Data Division:**

*   **Working-Storage Section:**
    *   Two data items are defined:
        *   `NUM01`: A signed 9-digit numeric field initialized with the value -5000.
        *   `STR01`: A 9-character alphanumeric field initialized with the value 'ABCDF'.

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Type Check for STR01:** An `IF` statement examines the contents of `STR01` using the `IS ALPHABETIC` condition:
    *   If `STR01` contains only alphabetic characters, it displays "STR01 IS ALPHABETIC."
2.  **Type Check for NUM01:** Another `IF` statement checks `NUM01` with the `IS NUMERIC` condition:
   *   If `NUM01` contains only numeric characters, it displays "NUM01 IS NUMERIC."
3.  **Additional Type Check for STR01:** A third `IF` statement again evaluates `STR01`, this time using the `IS NUMERIC` condition:
    *   If `STR01` does **not** contain only numeric characters (i.e., it contains alphabetic characters), it displays "STR01 ISNT NUMERIC IS ALPHABETIC."
4.  **Program Termination:** The `GOBACK` statement concludes the program's execution.

**Summary:**

This COBOL code showcases elementary data type verification mechanisms by leveraging the `IS ALPHABETIC` and `IS NUMERIC` conditions. It effectively distinguishes between numeric and alphabetic content within data items.
