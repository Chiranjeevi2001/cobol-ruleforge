## COBOL Code Analysis: Data Type Validation Program

The provided COBOL code demonstrates the evaluation of data types for two variables, `NUM01` and `STR01`, and displays messages based on the results. Below is a summary of its structure and functionality:

**Data Division:**

*   **Working-Storage Section:** 
    *   Two data items are defined:
        *   `NUM01`: A signed numeric field initialized with the value -5000.
        *   `STR01`: A 9-character alphanumeric field initialized with the value 'ABCDF'.

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Alphanumeric Check for STR01:** The first `IF` statement examines the content of `STR01` using the `IS ALPHABETIC` condition. If all characters in `STR01` are alphabetical, it displays "STR01 IS ALPHABETIC."
2.  **Numeric Check for NUM01:** The second `IF` statement checks if `NUM01` is numeric using the `IS NUMERIC` condition. If `NUM01` contains only numeric characters, it displays "NUM01 IS NUMERIC."
3.  **Numeric Check for STR01 with Else:** The third `IF` statement again evaluates `STR01` with the `IS NUMERIC` condition. However, this time it includes an `ELSE` clause:
    *   **Numeric Condition:** If `STR01` is numeric, it displays "STR01 IS NUMERIC."
    *   **Alphanumeric Condition:** Otherwise, it displays "STR01 ISNT NUMERIC IS ALPHABETIC."

4.  **Program Termination:** The program concludes its execution with the `GOBACK` statement, which returns control to the operating system.

**Summary:**

This COBOL program demonstrates basic data validation techniques. It determines whether the content of two variables matches specific data types (numeric or alphabetic) and provides appropriate messages to the user.
