## COBOL Code Analysis: Conditional Branching and Value Evaluation

The provided COBOL program illustrates the use of conditional branching based on the value of a data item. Here's a summary of its functionality:

### Data Division

* **Working-Storage Section:** Defines a three-digit numeric variable named `M_NUMBER`. 
* Two condition names, `M_TRUE` and `M_FALSE`, are associated with `M_NUMBER` using the `88` level indicator. 
    * `M_TRUE` is established for values between 30 and 100, inclusive.
    * `M_FALSE` is established for values between 000 and 40, inclusive.

### Procedure Division

1. **Initialization:** The program sets `M_NUMBER` to 50.
2. **Conditional Branching:**
    * The first `IF` statement checks if `M_NUMBER`  satisfies the condition `M_TRUE`. If `M_NUMBER` is between 30 and 100 (inclusive), the program proceeds with the first `DISPLAY` statement.
    * The second `IF` statement checks if `M_NUMBER` satisfies the condition `M_FALSE`. If `M_NUMBER` is between 000 and 40 (inclusive), the program proceeds with the second `DISPLAY` statement.
3. **Output:**
    * If neither condition is met, no output is produced.
    * If `M_TRUE` is met, the program displays a message indicating that the condition was passed, along with the value of `M_NUMBER`.
    * If `M_FALSE` is met, the program displays a message indicating that the condition failed, along with the value of `M_NUMBER`.
4. **Looping:** The `GOBACK` statement causes the program to return to the beginning of the `MAIN-PROCEDURE` paragraph, allowing the evaluation and output process to be repeated.

### Summary

This COBOL program offers a simple illustration of using condition names and `IF` statements to conditionally execute code based on the value of a data item. It demonstrates the concept of logical branching and provides a foundation for more complex conditional logic in COBOL programs.
