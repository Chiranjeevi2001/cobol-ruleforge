## COBOL Code Analysis: Conditional Evaluation Program

The provided COBOL code evaluates whether a specified number meets certain conditions and displays appropriate messages based on the result. Below is a breakdown of its structure and functionality:

**Data Division:**

*   **Working-Storage Section:**
    *   The program defines a three-digit numeric variable, `M_NUMBER`, to store the input value.
    *   Two condition names, `M_TRUE` and `M_FALSE`, are established using the `88` level number:
        *   `M_TRUE`: Evaluates to true if `M_NUMBER` is between 30 and 100 (inclusive).
        *   `M_FALSE`: Evaluates to true if `M_NUMBER` is between 000 and 40 (inclusive).

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Value Assignment:** The program initializes `M_NUMBER` with the value 50.
2.  **True Condition Evaluation:** The first `IF` statement checks if `M_TRUE` evaluates to true, indicating that `M_NUMBER` falls within the range of 30 to 100:
    *   If true, the program displays a message indicating that the evaluation passed with the specified number of marks (`M_NUMBER`).
3.  **False Condition Evaluation:** The second `IF` statement checks if `M_FALSE` evaluates to true, indicating that `M_NUMBER` falls within the range of 000 to 40:
    *   If true, the program displays a message indicating that the evaluation failed with the specified number of marks (`M_NUMBER`).
4.  **Program Termination:** After both conditions have been evaluated, the `GOBACK` statement returns control to the operating system, effectively terminating the program's execution.

**Summary:**

This COBOL program showcases the use of condition names to evaluate a given value against predefined criteria. Based on the value of `M_NUMBER`, it displays appropriate messages to indicate whether the evaluation passed or failed.
