## COBOL Code Analysis: Groceries Shopping Simulation

This COBOL code simulates a simplified grocery shopping scenario, allowing users to purchase various items within a set budget and bag capacity.

**Data Division:**

*   **Working-Storage Section:**
    * 
      * **SHOP Record:**
        * `OP`: Operation mode (1 for open, 0 for closed)
        * `QT-VEG`, `QT-MEAT`, `QT-BREAD`, `QT-MILK`, `QT-FRUIT`: Quantities of vegetables, meat, bread, milk, and fruit available in the store
        * `PR-VEG`, `PR-MEAT`, `PR-BREAD`, `PR-MILK`, `PR-FRUIT`: Prices of the corresponding items
    * Other variables:
        * `MONEY`: Available budget for shopping
        * `REST`: Remaining budget after purchases
        * `BAG`: Number of items in the shopping bag
        * `MAX-CAP`: Maximum capacity of the bag
        * `RAND`: Random number generator
        * `NEED`: Flag indicating whether an item is required

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Initialization (INIT):**
    * Checks the operation mode. If open (OP = 1), initializes product quantities and prices, then proceeds with shopping. Otherwise, indicates that the shop is closed.
2.  **Shopping Loop:**
    * Iterates through the available items (`BUY-VEG`, `BUY-MEAT`, `BUY-BREAD`, `BUY-MILK`, `BUY-FRUIT`).
    * For each item, checks if it is needed and available, and if the budget and bag capacity allow for its purchase. If so, adds the item to the bag and updates the budget and quantities.
3.  **Budget/Capacity Check (CHECK):**
    * Checks if the budget is exhausted or the bag is full. If not, continues shopping.
4.  **Print Results (PRINT):**
    * Displays the remaining budget and the number of items in the bag.
5.  **Need Calculation (ISNEEDED):**
    * Randomly generates a flag (NEED) indicating whether an item is needed.
6.  **Initialization Helper (INIT-PRD):**
    * Randomly initializes the quantities and prices of the items for a new shopping session.

**Summary:**

This program simulates a basic shopping experience, allowing users to purchase groceries within a set budget and bag capacity. It demonstrates the use of data structures, conditional branching, iteration, and random number generation in COBOL.
