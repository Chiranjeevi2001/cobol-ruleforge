## COBOL Code Analysis: Rental Car Payment Calculator (PROD2V1) 

The provided COBOL code, labeled PROD2V1, functions as a payment calculation program for a rental car service. It reads input data from a file, performs calculations based on the input, and generates an output file with the calculated payment details. Below is a detailed breakdown of its structure and functionality:

**Data Division:**

*   **File Section:**
    *   **RENTAL:** Sequential input file containing rental-related information. Fields include client name, rental type (initial, car type, kilometers traveled, number of days rented), and more.
    *   **RENTAL-OUT:** Sequential output file to store calculated payment and updated rental information. 
*   **Working-Storage Section:**
    *   Various numeric and character variables used for intermediate calculations and storage of results, such as `KILOMETERS_PAYMENT`, `RENTAL_DAYS_TOTAL`, and more.

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Main Procedure:**
    *   Opens the input and output files.
    *   Reads a record from the input file.
    *   Initiates the `CALCULATIONS` paragraph, which processes each record until an end-of-file condition is encountered.
    *   Closes both input and output files.
    *   Terminates the program execution.
2.  **CALCULATIONS Paragraph:**
    *   Copies various fields from the input record to the output record, including client name, rental type, kilometers, and number of days.
    *   Performs kilometer-based calculations: If the kilometers traveled exceed 75, it subtracts 75 from the total.
    *   Utilizes an `EVALUATE` statement to determine the rental car brand based on the rental type:
        *   Type 1: Volkswagen, with specific payment calculations.
        *   Type 2: Toyota, with specific payment calculations.
        *   Type 3: Mercedes, with specific payment calculations.
    *   Calculates the total rental cost based on kilometers traveled, rental days, and car brand.
    *   Writes the updated rental information and calculated payment to the output file.
    *   Displays the output record on the console.
    *   Reads the next record from the input file, repeating the process until the end of the file is reached.

**Summary:**

This COBOL program is a data processing application that calculates rental car payments based on kilometers traveled, rental days, and car brand. It reads input data from a file, performs calculations, and generates an output file with the updated rental information and calculated payment.
