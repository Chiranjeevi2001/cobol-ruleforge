## COBOL Code Analysis: Loan Quote Service
The provided COBOL code performs a simple loan rate inquiry for an incoming account number. Here's a breakdown of its structure and functionality:

**Working-Storage Section:**

*   **ACCOUNT-NUMBER-IN:** A 4-character field to store the input account number from the calling program.
*   **RETURN-DATA:** 
    *   **LOAN-RATE:** An 8-character field to store the loan rate associated with the provided account number.
*   **CONTAINER-NAMES:**
    *   **INPUT-CONTAINER:** A 16-character field containing the name of the input container that holds the account number.
    *   **GETLOAN-CONTAINER:** A 16-character field containing the name of a container to return the loan rate.
*   **COMMAND-RESP** and **COMMAND-RESP2**: Status flag indicators for the CICS commands.

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Load Estimation:** The program checks the current date and displays an estimated wait time for the loan quote service, depending on the system load.
2.  **Account Number Retrieval:** The `CICS GET CONTAINER` command retrieves the input container and populates the `ACCOUNT-NUMBER-IN` field with the account number.
3.  **Loan Rate Determination:** Based on the input account number, the program sets the loan rate accordingly:
    *   If the account number is '0001', the loan rate is set to '1.25'.
    *   Otherwise, the loan rate is set to '7.20'.
4.  **Loan Rate Return:** The `CICS PUT CONTAINER` command populates the loan rate into the specified output container.
5.  **Program Termination:** The program ends with the `CICS RETURN` command, returning control to the calling program.

**Summary:**

This COBOL program serves as a basic implementation of a loan quote service. It retrieves an account number from the input container, determines the corresponding loan rate, and returns the rate in an output container. The program includes error handling for the CICS commands and provides an estimated wait time based on system load.
