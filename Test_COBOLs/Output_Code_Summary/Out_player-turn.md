## COBOL Code Analysis: Player Turn in a Card Game
The provided COBOL code is a fragment of a program that simulates a player's turn in a card game. It focuses on determining the player's bid based on their strategy and the prize card.

**Data Division:**

*   **Local-Storage Section:**
    *   Several data items are defined:
        *   `PLAYER-REC`: A record containing player-specific information, including name, bid, points, strategy, and hand.
        *   `PRIZE-CARD`: A two-digit integer representing the prize card.
        *   `STRATEGY-NEXT`, `STRATEGY-MAX`, `STRATEGY-NEAREST`: Constants representing different bidding strategies.
*   **Linkage Section:**
    *   Links the `PLAYER-REC` and `PRIZE-CARD` data items to the program's working storage.

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Initialization:** The player's bid is initialized to 0.
2.  **Card Picking Loop:** The `PERFORM PICK-CARD` statement begins a loop that iterates over the player's hand.
3.  **Bidding Strategy:** The `IF` statement within the `PICK-CARD` paragraph evaluates the player's bidding strategy (`PLAYER-STRATEGY`):
    *   `STRATEGY-NEXT`: Calls the "strategy-next" subroutine to determine the bid.
    *   `STRATEGY-MAX`: Calls the "strategy-max" subroutine to determine the bid.
    *   `STRATEGY-NEAREST`: Calls the "strategy-nearest" subroutine to determine the bid.
    *   Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

**Subroutines:**

The subroutines referenced in the code, "strategy-next," "strategy-max," and "strategy-nearest," are not included in the provided code fragment. They are likely responsible for calculating the player's bid based on the specified strategy.

**Summary:**

This COBOL code fragment demonstrates the use of data structures, decision-making, and subroutine calls to simulate a player's turn in a card game. The choice of bidding strategy affects the player's bid, which is determined by the corresponding subroutine.

**Note:** The provided code contains an unconditional `GOBACK` statement without a corresponding `PERFORM`. This may indicate a coding error or incomplete code snippet.
