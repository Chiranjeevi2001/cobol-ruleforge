## COBOL Code Analysis: Card Game Player Turn Processing
The provided COBOL code segment appears to be part of a card game simulation or application. It deals with a player's turn, specifically focusing on determining their bid and selecting cards based on their chosen strategy. Below is a summary of the code's functionality:

**Data Division:**

*   **Local-Storage Section:** 
    *   A two-digit integer `I` is declared for use as a loop counter.
    *   Three constants (`STRATEGY-NEXT`, `STRATEGY-MAX`, `STRATEGY-NEAREST`) are defined to represent player strategy options.

*   **Linkage Section:** 
    *   A constant `NUM-CARDS` is defined, specifying the number of cards in the player's hand.
    *   Two PIC 9(2) fields, `PRIZE-CARD` and `PLAYER-BID`, are declared to store the prize card value and the player's bid, respectively.
    *   A group item `PLAYER-REC` is defined to hold player-related data:
        *   `PLAYER-NAME`: Six-character player name
        *   `PLAYER-BID`: Two-digit player bid
        *   `PLAYER-POINTS`: Two-digit player points
        *   `PLAYER-STRATEGY`: One-digit player strategy
        *   `PLAYER-HAND`: An array of two-digit integers representing the player's hand

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Bid Initialization:** The `MOVE` statement initializes the player's bid to 0.
2.  **Card Selection:** The `PERFORM` statement calls the `PICK-CARD` paragraph for each card in the player's hand (`I` ranges from 1 to `NUM-CARDS`).
3.  **Card Selection Logic:**
    *   If the player's bid is still 0, the `IF` statement determines the player's strategy and calls the appropriate subroutine:
        *   `STRATEGY-NEXT`: Calls the subroutine `strategy-next` to determine the bid and card selection based on the next card in the hand.
        *   `STRATEGY-MAX`: Calls the subroutine `strategy-max` to determine the bid and card selection based on the highest card in the hand.
        *   `STRATEGY-NEAREST`: Calls the subroutine `strategy-nearest` to determine the bid and card selection based on the card closest to the prize card.
        *   For any other strategy value, an error message is displayed.
4.  **Loop Termination:** The `GOBACK` statement exits the `PERFORM` loop once all cards have been processed.

**Summary:**

This COBOL code segment encapsulates the logic for a player's turn in a card game. It initializes the player's bid, iterates through the player's hand, and calls subroutines to determine the bid and card selection based on the player's chosen strategy. The code is well-structured and utilizes PERFORM and IF statements effectively to manage the flow of logic.
