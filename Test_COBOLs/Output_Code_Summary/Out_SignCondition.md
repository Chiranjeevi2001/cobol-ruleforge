## COBOL Code Analysis: Sign Condition Determination Program

This COBOL program serves a specific purpose: it examines three numeric variables and displays conclusions about their sign and zero status. A detailed breakdown of its structure and functionality is provided below:

**Data Division:**

*   **Working-Storage Section:** 
    *   Three numeric variables are defined and initialized with specific values:
        *   `NUM01` (signed 9-digit integer): Initialized to -5000, representing a negative value.
        *   `NUM02` (signed 9-digit integer): Initialized to 6, representing a positive value.
        *   `NUM03` (unsigned 9-digit integer): Initialized to 0.

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Main Procedure:** This is the entry point of the program.
2.  **Sign Condition Evaluation:** The program employs a series of `IF` statements to assess the sign condition of each variable:
    *   **`NUM01` Evaluation:**
        *   `IS POSITIVE` clause: If `NUM01` is greater than 0, the program displays a message indicating that `NUM01` is positive.
        *   `IS NEGATIVE` clause: If `NUM01` is less than 0, the program displays a message indicating that `NUM01` is negative.
    *   **`NUM02` Evaluation:**
        *   `IS ZERO` clause: If `NUM02` is equal to 0, the program displays a message indicating that `NUM02` is zero.
        *   `IS POSITIVE` clause: If `NUM02` is greater than 0, the program displays a message indicating that `NUM02` is positive.
    *   **`NUM03` Evaluation:**
        *   `IS ZERO` clause: If `NUM03` is equal to 0, the program displays a message indicating that `NUM03` is zero.
        *   `IS POSITIVE` clause: Note that since `NUM03` is an unsigned variable, the `IS POSITIVE` clause is redundant and will never be executed.
3.  **Program Termination:** After executing the sign condition evaluations, the program utilizes the `GOBACK` statement to terminate its execution and return control to the operating system.

**Summary:**

This COBOL program showcases the use of `IF` statements to examine the sign and zero status of numeric variables. It effectively categorizes the variables based on their respective conditions and displays appropriate messages.
