## COBOL Code Analysis: Sign Condition Evaluation Program
The provided COBOL code demonstrates the evaluation of sign conditions for numeric variables. It incorporates multiple conditional statements to determine whether the values are positive, negative, or zero. Below is a breakdown of its functionality:

**Data Division:**

*   **Working-Storage Section:** The program declares three numeric variables:
    *   `NUM01` is initialized with a negative value (-5000) and has a length of 9 digits, including a sign.
    *   `NUM02` is initialized with a positive value (6) and has a length of 9 digits, including a sign.
    *   `NUM03` is initialized with zero and has a length of 9 digits.

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Sign Evaluation:** The program employs a series of `IF` statements to check the sign condition of each variable:
    *   **`NUM01`:** If the value of `NUM01` is positive, it displays the message "NUM01 IS POSITIVE." If it's negative, it displays "NUM01 IS NEGATIVE."
    *   **`NUM02`:** If the value of `NUM02` is zero, it displays "NUM02 IS ZERO." If it's positive, it displays "NUM02 IS POSITIVE."
    *   **`NUM03`:** If the value of `NUM03` is zero, it displays "NUM03 IS ZERO." If it's positive, it displays "NUM03 IS POSITIVE."

2.  **Program Conclusion:** After evaluating the sign conditions, the program issues a `GOBACK`, which effectively ends its execution.

**Summary:**

This COBOL program illustrates the use of conditional statements to assess the sign conditions of numeric variables. It categorizes the variables as positive, negative, or zero, providing insights into their numeric characteristics.
