## COBOL Code Analysis: Academic Evaluation Program

The COBOL code provided, identified as PROGCOB08, is designed to calculate the average of two grades and assess the academic standing of a student based on that average. Let's delve into its structure and functionality:

**Data Division:**

* **Working-Storage Section:**
    * Three numeric variables are declared:
        * `WRK-NOTA1`: A two-digit integer representing the first grade.
        * `WRK-NOTA2`: A two-digit integer representing the second grade.
        * `WRK-MEDIA`: A four-digit integer (two integer digits and two decimal digits) to store the calculated average.

**Procedure Division:**

1. **Input Acquisition:** The program consecutively prompts the user to enter two grades, storing them in the `WRK-NOTA1` and `WRK-NOTA2` variables using the `ACCEPT` verb.
2. **Average Calculation:** The `COMPUTE` statement calculates the arithmetic average of the two grades and stores the result in `WRK-MEDIA`. This average is a key indicator for evaluating the student's performance.
3. **Academic Evaluation:** The `EVALUATE` statement evaluates the `WRK-MEDIA` variable to determine the student's academic standing based on the following conditions:
    * **Threshold for Distinction:** If `WRK-MEDIA` is equal to 10, the program displays the message "APROVADO + BONUS," indicating that the student has not only passed but has also earned a bonus.
    * **Passing Grades:** If `WRK-MEDIA` is in the range of 6.0 to 9.9, the program displays the message "SITUACAO: APROVADO," indicating that the student has passed the course.
    * **Conditional Passing:** If `WRK-MEDIA` is in the range of 2.0 to 5.9, the program displays the message "RECUPERACAO," indicating that the student must take recovery measures to pass the course.
    * **Failing Grade:** For any other value of `WRK-MEDIA`, the program displays the message "REPROVADO," indicating that the student has failed the course.
4. **Termination:** The program concludes its execution with the `STOP RUN` statement.

**Summary:**

This COBOL program demonstrates basic data input, arithmetic operations, and conditional evaluation. It effectively provides a straightforward assessment of a student's academic performance based on two input grades.
