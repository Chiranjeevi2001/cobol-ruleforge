## COBOL Code Analysis: FizzBuzz Problem

The provided COBOL code implements the FizzBuzz algorithm, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100. For each number, specific rules determine whether to print "Fizz" (if divisible by 3), "Buzz" (if divisible by 5), "FizzBuzz" (if divisible by both 3 and 5), or the number itself (if not divisible by either).

**Data Division:**

*   **Working-Storage Section:** 
    *   Two variables are declared:
        *   `COUNTER`: A three-digit integer used to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100.
        *   `NONSENSE`: An eight-character alphanumeric variable to store the output for each number, which can be "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself. 

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Initialization:** The `PERFORM` statement with the `VARYING` clause sets up a loop that iterates the `COUNTER` from 1 to 100.
2.  **Output Initialization:** Before each iteration, the `MOVE ALL SPACES` statement clears the `NONSENSE` variable to prepare it for the new output. 
3.  **FizzBuzz Calculation:** An `EVALUATE` statement with multiple `WHEN` clauses determines the output based on the current value of `COUNTER`: 
    *   If `COUNTER` is divisible by both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is assigned to `NONSENSE` (the FizzBuzz condition)
    *   If `COUNTER` is divisible by 3 but not by 5, "Fizz" is assigned to `NONSENSE` (the Fizz condition)
    *   If `COUNTER` is divisible by 5 but not by 3, "Buzz" is assigned to `NONSENSE` (the Buzz condition)
    *   If `COUNTER` is not divisible by either 3 or 5, the value of `COUNTER` itself is assigned to `NONSENSE` (the default condition)
4.  **Output Display:** The `DISPLAY` statement prints the contents of `NONSENSE`, which will be either "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself.
5. **Loop Continuation:** The `END-PERFORM` statement returns control to the `PERFORM` statement, incrementing `COUNTER` by 1 and continuing the loop until `COUNTER` reaches 101.
6.  **Program Termination:** The `STOP RUN` statement concludes the program's execution.

**Summary:**

This COBOL program demonstrates the use of looping, conditional branching, and string manipulation to implement the FizzBuzz algorithm. It effectively generates the desired sequence of outputs for numbers from 1 to 100.
