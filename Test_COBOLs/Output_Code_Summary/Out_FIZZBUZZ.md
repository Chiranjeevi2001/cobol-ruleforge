## COBOL Code Analysis: FizzBuzz Program
The provided COBOL code implements the classic "FizzBuzz" algorithm. It iteratively processes a range of numbers and prints either the number itself or one of the following strings based on divisibility rules:

-   "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
-   "Buzz" if it is divisible by 5
-  "FizzBuzz" if it is divisible by both 3 and 5

**Data Division:**

*   **Working-Storage Section:** 
    *   Two variables are declared:
        *   `COUNTER`: A three-digit numeric field used to iterate through the numbers.
        *   `NONSENSE`: An eight-character alphabetic field to store the output message.

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Loop Counter Initialization:** The `100-MAIN-PARA` paragraph initializes the `COUNTER` variable to 1 and enters a loop.
2.  **Number Range:** The loop continues until `COUNTER` reaches 101.
3.  **Clearing Output:** Before processing each number, the `MOVE ALL SPACES TO NONSENSE` statement clears the `NONSENSE` field.
4.  **FizzBuzz Logic:** An `EVALUATE` statement assesses the divisibility of `COUNTER`:
    *   If `COUNTER` is divisible by both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is moved to `NONSENSE`.
    *   If `COUNTER` is divisible by 3 but not 5, "Fizz" is moved to `NONSENSE`.
    *   If `COUNTER` is divisible by 5 but not 3, "Buzz" is moved to `NONSENSE`.
    *  Otherwise, the value of `COUNTER` is moved to `NONSENSE`.
5.  **Output Display:** The `DISPLAY NONSENSE` statement prints the contents of the `NONSENSE` field, which will be either a number or one of the specified strings.
6.  **Loop Termination:** The loop continues until `COUNTER` exceeds 100, at which point it exits.
7.  **Program Conclusion:** The `STOP RUN` statement terminates the program.

**Summary:**

This COBOL code utilizes loop structures, conditional branching, and numeric functions to implement the FizzBuzz algorithm. It effectively identifies and outputs the appropriate string or number for each value in the specified range.
