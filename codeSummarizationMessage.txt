## COBOL Code Analysis: Parity Determination Program
The provided COBOL code implements a straightforward algorithm to determine the parity (even or odd) of an integer input. Below is a breakdown of its structure and functionality:

**Data Division:**

*   **Working-Storage Section:** 
    *   Three numeric variables are declared:
        *   `NUM`: A two-digit integer intended to store the user's input.
        *   `QUOTIENT`: A two-digit integer to hold the result of dividing `NUM` by 2.
        *   `REMAIN`: A single-digit integer to store the remainder of the division operation.

**Procedure Division:**

1.  **Input Acquisition:** The `ACCEPT` verb prompts the user for input and stores the provided value in the `NUM` variable.
2.  **Parity Calculation:** The `DIVIDE` verb performs integer division of `NUM` by 2. The resulting quotient is stored in `QUOTIENT`, and the remainder is stored in `REMAIN`.  The remainder is the key to determining parity.
3.  **Parity Evaluation:** An `IF` statement assesses the value of `REMAIN`:
    *   **Even Condition:** If `REMAIN` is equal to 0, the program displays a message indicating that the input number is even. 
    *   **Odd Condition:** Otherwise, the program displays a message indicating that the input number is odd.
4.  **Termination:** The program concludes its execution with the `STOP RUN` statement.

**Summary:**

This COBOL program offers a basic example of input processing, arithmetic operations, and conditional branching. It effectively categorizes an integer as either even or odd based on the remainder after division by 2.
